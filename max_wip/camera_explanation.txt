To use the camera:

1. you need to make sure the launch file for your world is spawning a burger with cam
You need to edit the launch file very minimally to do this: check my launch file its just one line changing the model
You also need to make sure to export the burger_cam model like this when u launch a world
eg:
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger_cam
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo island_maze_cam.launch.py


2. If you want to see the live feed of the camera, open a new terminal and run:
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view


3. The colour detection module works by taking the raw camera data, findign the average R, G B values in the centre of the image (arbitrarily cjose centre third)
Then if R > 80 and G, B < 50 it returns RED, same for GREEN, otherwise returns NONE. This is published to a topic called 
"/wall_colour" as a string: you should be able easily subscribe to this from within the driver module to make decisions based off of what colour it is seeing.
